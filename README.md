Simple Java program that can encrypt or decrypt a String message taken from command line arguments or a text file and print to the console or save to a text file. 
The encryption/decryption methods take a String and a key that allow the message to be encrypted/decrypted by shifting the characters according to their Unicode value.
Two different classes allow two different methodologies to perform the encryption and decreptyion. Shift simply moves the character ahead in the alphabet while the unicode
class goes ahead with respect to the entire unicode index. This project a part of JetBrains Academy and all solutions and classes are completely unique and written by myself.
